This script will print an "A" to the console
It will ignore every character that is not used in the Brainfuck language
As an example I will add a few comments as to what the program does
The backslashes are only used for better readability

++++++++	//Increase cell 0 by 8
[		//While cell 0 is greater than 0
>		//Move pointer to cell 1	
++++++++	//Increase cell 1 by 8
<		//move pointer to cell 0
-		//decreate pointer by 1 
]		//While cell 1 is greater than 0 go back to line 2 otherwise continue
		//The above Loop will effectively set the value of cell 1 to be 64 (8x8)
		//This is way shorter than increasing the value in that cell 64 times
>		//move pointer from cell 0 to cell 1
+		//Increase value in cell 1 by 1
.		//Output Value of cell 1 as ASCII character (65=A)
